"Most moves that include X, X, and X likely fall under X bending." is false because styles are philosophies that moves are born from, not categories that moves fall under.

# Primary Earth-styles:
The fundamentals of earthbending. Don't be surprised if you meet a master who incorporates all of these styles into their fighting style.
#### **Three Rock Principles** ^[Written by mr_lux43]

1. Be like a Rock, steady.

> _From the old masters, the true rumbler knows that the first step is to not move._

When one acts, your upper body as to be locked, hands in the line with your shoulders, spine straight, gaze forward. This is a physical requirement, not just an idea. You must imagine three lines starting from you and going forward:

- one from each shoulder;,
- one from the middle of your eyes.

2. Act like a Rock, whole.

> _A legend tells of a pebble asking the mountain if it ever wanted to see around. The mountain said that she did, but all at once so none knew she had moved._

When you want to move around, you still have to answer to the first principle. In that case, know that everything has to move together like a rock going downhill. Your spine stays straight, it's the hips that turn around, your shoulders stay stiff, it's the upper body that rotates. Even when using Stick Rotation, the upper body does not move in parts. You want to look on the right? Rotate the spine, let the neck follow and the shoulder align. Tense the arms and act as a whole. If you need more range, physically do a small step and rotate the body by twisting your leg and bring back the other one. You want to duck, down or sideways, it's a side step or a squat, while tensing the spine to keep everything in line. Keeping yourself whole gets you to be more agile and responsive when you want to do a pose again.

3. Push the Rock, don't be Pushed by them.

> _Little is know about the first rumblers, but all scholars agree that they weren't ones to forget that rocks like to fight back._

Rumbling will mostly be about pushing structures (rocks) forward, and they will push back each time. You want to be aware of that, expect that, play with that. Every time you want to Straight a structure, you have to know that the Knockback will make you step in the opposite direction. The more poses you do the more acute this reaction gets. The explode will add to that. A rumbler understand that this will put them in a situation where if they want to attack they will get back.

#### **Ethics of Rock Throwing** ^[Written by Maple]

Although it's fun to throw rocks at people, you must remember some key, unspoken rules that we abide by to make sure everyone has fun. Though, "abide" is a strong word. These rules aren't strict or followed by everyone. They are a general guideline for new players to understand what could be accidently taken as bad manners. If someone does one of these to you, it just means they do not know or do not see it as mean or unfair.
**Never harass a player for 'breaking' rock throwing etiquette or for following it.**
^ Maple will personally come and ' dEdEdE ' spam you if you harass each other over made up rules.

1. Disc Finishers
In a casual match between two players of widely different skill ranges, it is rather anti-climactic and sometimes rude to finish the match with a disc or ' dS ' combo.
This varies from player to player, and excluded from most tournaments, because in practice, it is the responsibility of the low-health player to protect themselves further.
Overall, it is still nice, especially when the skill range is far or the ping is high, to allow the match to go until a more climactic or interesting conclusion shows itself.
\-
2. Player Launching / Stunlocking
If a structure other than a disc is summoned below a player, it will knock them off the ground, removing their ability to summon a structure and dealing damage. If this is done consecutively, it can combo the player into a rather infuriating situation.
The rule many follow is no more than one player launch in a row, allowing the player to flow away or at least touch the ground.

3. False Starts
Being a VR game, it's not uncommon for issues to arise only once you've loaded into a match. If you can clearly see a player is fiddling with controllers or headsets, and is not assuming base pose, then it is polite to wait.
If you fear being misguided, you can spawn a wall.
Once they are back, you can slide a pillar to the right side of the arena and send a ' dE ' at it to create a new count down.
The AFK player can then speed disc the pillar once they are ready to signal the new beginning of the fight.

4. Dynamic Pace
Once you've become a long-term player of RUMBLE, you'll find your spawn pace and general knowledge of the game greatly overshadow many new players.
The entropic matchmaking of RUMBLE is both a blessing and a curse.
It is good that new players can see people from every skill range. It prevents overfitting, skill-domain based metas, and makes the game generally more interesting.
Even so, if you are far outpacing your opponent to the point of not seeing any of their structures, it is usually polite to slow down even just a little bit. You don't have to teach them, but you also should take the opportunity to practice ways of play that can allow both of you to have fun.
\-
5. Ascension
Allowing someone to easily hit an Ascension on you can invalidate their Ascension. At the same time, it is nice when a perfect, clean Ascension doesn't get anti-aired. It's hard to put it into words.
A good way of putting it:
> "Sometimes, you just have to slow down and look in awe at your opponent's work of art."

# Secondary Earth-styles:
More specific styles that may incorporate two sub-styles. 
#### **Waterbending**
Use of flick or hold to cancel out or deflect incoming attacks. Waterbending philosophies were brought into earth to supplement the punctual nature of traditional fighting styles, opening up never seen before weaknesses. Overall, the idea is to bring incoming rocks back into their origin: other rocks and not you.

#### **Firebending**
Usually seen as a use of volatile. Encompassing the idea of hit hard and refuse to let your opponent breathe. This style often includes risky moves that can put both sides in danger. Camping with charge volatile is NOT firebending, that's bending fire like a rock, not rocks like a fire.

#### **Airbending**
Through flick and hold, an earthbender can achieve flight. Airbending in terms of bending rocks means taking the rocks into the air and assuming airbender-like stances, holds, and techniques to outmaneuver your opponent. Airbending's key nature is to move freely with the flow; like a leaf in the wind.

# Further Tertiary-styles:
More specific styles that may incorporate two sub-styles. 
#### **Cloudbending**
Mixture of waterbending philosophies and aerial moves. Using the patience that comes with both styles to its maximum, judging the push and pull of the fight and reacting accordingly.

#### **Starbending**
Lackluster and floaty, this philosophy was born from the aerial nature of airbending and protective firebending. Volatile hold flight is a staple of starbending.

# Obscure Styles:
This a category for styles that are born from game tech and bugs turned into features.
#### **Soulbending**
If one tries hard enough, they can pass through rocks as if they were just made of water.

#### **Bloodbending**
What if you were to use waterbending on a player?

#### **Metalbending**
Your are more than the rocks. You will not be trampled by itty bitty pebbles.
