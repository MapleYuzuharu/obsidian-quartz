## Maple, Maple Tree
A rumbler who's fighting style changes like the seasons. Sometimes I'll be a fiery volatile red leaf, and other times a mellow charge yellow leaf. 

In non-VR games, I often play flexible movement characters and classes that aren't particularly quick but can move fluidly between high-low ground or change their direction constantly. I'd like to think my earthbending style contains some of this nature.

I heard of RUMBLE back towards it's release but didn't buy the game until I saw shoeless's second video on the game. After which, being someone who's easily swayed by movie-like editing (shout out to IvoryTV's Whitepine series), I instantly started labbing in singleplayer while living in the middle of nowhere (very bad ping).
*Lot's of people say I'm really good for my BP, which comes from all that single-player labbing and a generally quick reaction time. Make high level plays I don't understand and I crumble lol*

When I'm not rumbling, I play a lot of games with friends like Warframe and Overwatch. I'm a massive fan of the Calamity mod for Terraria, particularly the beautiful music and art.
I started video editing back in middle school and have a decent self-taught background in the hobby. You likely won't see me making anything for Rumble any time soon though :sob:
I'm somewhat of a programmer, having made Minecraft mods and plugins. I'd like to contribute to the modding community of RUMBLE at some point in the future.


**As of right now, I play with a muted mic due to personal reasons. I do understand you (if you speak English) and will attempt to gesture my responses.**
